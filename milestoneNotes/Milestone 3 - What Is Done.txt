Been working on this all reading week. I have gotten something basic working.

To Run (from the Root folder)
npm install
node prashfour

http://localhost:3000
https://github.com/CarletonU-COMP2406-W2013/PrashFour/issues/12

NOTE: node-irc throws it's own errors for unhandled things, it's to be ignored because we're not coding every handling thing for every IRCd that exists

Functionality Worked on:
    Socket.io Communication Between Server/Client
        PING/PONG implemented, so we can measure latency to server (currently just logs to client console)
    Communication between Server and node-irc (Specifically)
        Client Side Commands:
            /join (joins a channel)
            /part (parts a channel)
            /nick (changes nick)
            /topic (changes topic - assuming right permissions)
            /me (* action)
            /query (private conversation opener with a user) -- Will eventually be triggered by clicking nick
            
        What Server Broadcasts / What Client Can Handle Appropriately:
            Being "noticed" (windowless PM)
            MOTD of the Server
            Messages (primary thing, messages in chat room)
            PM (private chat)
            Join/Part events
            Quit Events (someone else closed their client)
            NAMES (used to get list of people in channel)
            TOPIC (gets the topic for a channel)
    Design Hooks
        Inputs fields and HTML elemnts have classes and ID's that can be hooked on via templating systems and can have CSS added to individual elements
          
    IRCSocketConnect.js
        Creates a node-irc instance, attaches it to a specific socket, and then sends it the events that are currently coded (see above)
    SocketHandler.js
        Handles the socket between client and server, is responsible for sending to client IRC messages from server, and also getting messages from the client to the IRC server

    
      
Functionality Not Yet Implemented:
    Design (Big one, but not yet, just this took me all week...)
        User List:
            <nick> <Private Message Button> <etc>
    Hint-Box (Will have clickable buttons to auto-insert commands into the chat-box)
        Additionally, add a "listAllCommands()" to irc.commands that can auto-populate the hint-box.
    DATABASE BACKEND
        User accounts
        Persistent IRC connection (can be done natively with node-irc)
        Saving logs for chats when logged in
        When re-joining a room, retrieve old logs
        Have not done the "Schema" for Mongo yet.
    Etc's
        TBD
    

        
BUGS:
    lots. Chris will report what he can.
