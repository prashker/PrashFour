Server side login / Logging functionality has been implemented.

If mongodb is running on the default port it should disconnect no problem if node app is rune after launching mongo. 

Currently the "logging" only stores messages (so no joins/parts/kicks, etc)

We'll see how hard it'll be to implement the rest.

The professor said these are schema-less but they still have a sort of schema, so we have that in the models.js which mongoose handles nicely (much better than mongo).
