Motivation
==========

Our motivation (as avid IRC users, to hell with those who say it is outdated form of communication!) was to create a [bouncer-like](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=irc%20bouncer) IRC client that could be easily loaded up. There are already examples of good clients such as [ZNC](), which we've used in the past...but we've found that the setup for it is a hassle, configuration and maintenance is annoying, and generally clunky. To have something like this in a simple thing such as node allows for easy moveability and maintenance. The potential to run it on a [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) as a small always-on IRC client when we want to turn off our PC is so easy and something we look to do. Additionally, having a web based client allows us to remotely access our IRC connection whenever and wherever we want. There are already solutions like this such as [Mibbit](http://mibbit.org) and [IRCCloud](http://irccloud.com), however they are either paid solutions, or lack specific functionality and customizeability that we'd like to have (specifically, access to the source code)...having access to the source code is essentially having access to a venue to script extensibility into the client (case in point being mIRC's "mIRC Scripting Language", many trivia bots are coded in this)

There is a lot of potential for improvement, and we wouldn't exactly use this yet as a replacement (as we love mIRC), but we feel like at some point in time it can be evolved into something bigger, and better (see Extensions.md)
