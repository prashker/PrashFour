Initial Project Outline
=======================

Name: Web IRC

Description:

The goal of this project is to build web based IRC client with the ability to store chat logs and other information on
the serverside and allow users to talk to eachother over the internet (original idea do not steal). This concept lends
it's self well to additional functionality after the initial build is complete such as: remembering user information,
storing text logs and returning them to the user upon re-entry to the chatroom, multiple chatrooms, and others.

Technologies used (but not limited to):
 node-irc
 MongoDB (Mongoose?)
 jQuery UI
 jQuery
 Express
 Jade
 Socket.io
 
 
Milestones
==========

1. Determining the design for connecting node-irc with a simple front end client. (Sockets between Client/Server)
2. Artchitecture diagram and external library/program use
3. Implementing an almost barebones connection between node-irc and client (no design, one page, no security)
4. Elaborate on the user interface
5. Integrate the logging functionality (server side storing per user per channel)
6. Working prototype (all functionality implemented at a basic level)
7. Improve the design, optimize functionality
8. Draft documentation
9. Finishing touches (additional functionality, based on available time) + Final Code
