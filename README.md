Initial Project Outline

Name: Web IRC

Description:

The goal of this project is to build web based IRC client with the ability to store chat logs and other information on
the serverside and allow users to talk to eachother over the internet (original idea do not steal). This concept lends
it's self well to additional functionality after the initial build is complete such as: remembering user information,
storing text logs and returning them to the user upon re-entry to the chatroom, multiple chatrooms, and others.

Technologies used (but not limited to):
 node-irc
 MongoDB
 jQuery UI

The first milestone will be to have a functional client side user interface and a basic server to process a low amount
of users sending messages and the server returning those messages to the other users.
